      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 Yellow Onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 cup Carrot, finely diced</li>
    <li>14 oz Crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li> ¼ cup Tomato Paste</li>
    <li> 1 cup Dry Green Lentils</li>
    <li> 2 cups Vegetable Broth</li>
    <li>½ cup Parsley, chopped</li>
    <li>¼ cup Basil, chopped</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>             
    <li>3 large Eggplant, cut into ⅓” rounds</li> 
    <li>1 ½ cup Marinara Sauce of Choice</li> 
    <li>Vegan Ricotta</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
<li> Preheat the oven to 375F while you prepare all
    of the ingredients. Line 2-3 Baking Trays with parchment paper and fill
    each tray with the Eggplant “coins”, so none are overlapping. Bake for
    25 minutes, then remove from the oven.</li>
   <br> 
<li>  In the meantime, add the diced Onion to a
    large pot with a splash of Water or Oil; sauté over Medium heat for 3-4
    minutes, until translucent. Then, add the Carrot, Crushed Tomatoes,
    and Tomato Paste to the pot, stirring well. Once everything is well
    incorporated, add the Lentils, Vegetable Broth, Parsley, and Basil.
    Bring everything to a boil, then cover and simmer over low for 30
    minutes.</li>
    <br>  
<li> Spread 1/2 cup of Marinara Sauce over the base of
    a large casserole dish, then cover it well with 1/3 of the Eggplant – try
    to overlap it as tightly as possible!
    spread 1/2 of the cooked Lentil filling evenly across the
    Eggplant, followed by 1/3 of the Vegan Ricotta
    add another layer of Eggplant, then follow with the
    remainder of the Lentils and another 1/3 of the Ricotta.</li>
       <br> 
<li> Put back into oven at 375 for 25minutes  or until lightly browned on top
    and heated through.</li>
       
    </ol>
